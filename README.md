# Address-Book

Create a Contact class that can hold information and perform operations with
contact objects.  The basic idea here is that on a mobile phone, you typically
have a contacts list or address book. The Contact class must have the
following private data members. Note that this table provides just the basic
"word" names, you will have to use correct Python syntax to make these private
members in your program.
Demonstrate the class by writing an application for it using main and other
functions. Note that your application will include functions other than main,
which are not part of the class, but are needed to modularize your application
